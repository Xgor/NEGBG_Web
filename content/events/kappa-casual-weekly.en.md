We're playing casuals at Kappa Bar every week!

Join in, play, and have a beer with good company!

The most common games usually played are *Street Fighter 6*, *Tekken 8*, *Guilty Gear: -Strive-*, and *2XKO*.
But other games often show up too, such as
*Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves*, *Under Night In-Birth II Sys:Celes*, *BlazBlue: Centralfiction*, or *Umineko: Golden Fantasia*!
If you have a fighting game you really want to play, there's surely someone who'll be up for it!
